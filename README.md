#### Bike, Discoball, Dragon, Outdoor, Resolution, Statue, and Teaser Scenes
Each of the folders contains a calibration file, measurement files, and example reconstructions. 

The calibration files are named `tof.mat` and contain an image variable named `tofgrid`. This variable gives the time of flight in picoseconds to each scan point. Our example processing algorithms use this information to 'rectify' the measurements such that time zero coincides with the moment the light reflects off of the wall for all scan points. For the non-planar scan scenes we also include a variable, `pos`, which contains the 3D coordinate of each scan point relative to the confocal scanning hardware, and a `tof_raw.mat` file, which contains the raw time-of-flight measurement volume.

The measurement files are named `meas_[10,30,60,180]min.mat`, where the file name indicates the length of the exposure time in minutes. During the acquisition, we produce a complete scan every fifteen seconds, and so variable-length exposures can be compiled by accumulating the measurements over multiple scans. The files contain a 3D variable named `meas` of dimension 512x512x2048, with time being the last dimension. The time resolution of the measurements is 32 ps. 

Note that our acquisition procedure involves using a gated sensor to prevent recording the overwhelmingly bright direct reflection from the wall. The time at which the gate turns on varies with distance to the scan surface and is visible in the measurements as a transition to non-zero photon counts. Latency in changing the gate delay results in a small subset of the measurements being gated out (set to zero) at the beginning of the scan period.

Finally, we include example reconstructions (at 512x512 spatial resolution) for the planar scenes using filtered backprojection (FBP) the Light-Cone Transform (LCT) and f-k migration methods. The corresponding files contain the reconstructed albedo volumes for each exposure time; the reconstruction method and exposure time are indicated by the filename.

#### Interactive Scenes
These scenes were captured by rapidly scanning the wall at 2 or 4 fps and capturing 32 x 32 or 64 x64 spatial samples. The measurements capture a person moving around in a retroreflective outfit. The directory contains a set of 4D datafiles with 3D measurement volumes and f-k migration reconstructions for each captured frame. Videos of the scene captured with a conventional camera are also included. 
 
#### Non-Confocal Scene
The non-confocal processing is shown for an example scene from the [Zaragosa NLOS dataset](https://graphics.unizar.es/nlos_dataset.html). Before running the function, download the non-confocal dataset from the Zaragosa webpage or using this [direct link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1HZrlcSnme0qDLWanOlHgK2OgwLBeU6JX). We also provide example code for the NLOS dataset of [Klein et al.](https://nlos.cs.uni-bonn.de/). For convenience, we provide a direct [download link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1DISUkCfiA_NSBRrF7w8cBXduyH_m_EQa) to the example dataset we work with in a .mat format. 

#### Non-Planar Scene
A non-planar scene consisting of two retroreflective letters was captured by scanning a deformed projector screen. We include the measurements, calibration files, and reconstructed 3D volumes using f-k migration or filtered backprojection. `The nonplanar_reconstruction.m` file can be run to load the measurements and generate the reconstructions. See the file for additional details.

#### Phase Retrieval
A hybrid-input output phase retrieval algorithm can be used to process the teaser scene by running the `hio_reconstruction.m` file. We include the measurement volume used for processing, as well as full-resolution reconstructions of the initial volume and after 50 iterations of the algorithm.

#### Reconstruction Demo Program

Run the `demo.m` script to reconstruct a sample scene with FBP, LCT, f-k migration, and the [phasor fields method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1461-3) by Liu et al. We also demonstrate how to reconstruct the interactive results, the non-planar scene, and how to run the phase retrieval algorithm.
